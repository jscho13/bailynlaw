      <h3>Unsecured debt refers to loans and debts that are not “secured” by property such as a house or a car.

      Personal bank loans, credit card balances, and medical debt are all examples of unsecured debt. These, and certain other types of unsecured debt are dischargeable in a bankruptcy proceeding, which means that they can be eliminated and you will not have to repay them.
