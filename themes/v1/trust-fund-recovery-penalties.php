			<h3>In some cases, an individual can be held personally responsible by the IRS if a business fails to remit its “trust fund taxes” – the federal, Social Security and Medicare taxes withheld from employees’ paychecks.

</h3>
			<hr/>
			<p>Via the Trust Fund Recovery Penalty, the IRS could lien and/or levy this responsible person’s personal assets to collect these payroll taxes.


</p>
			<p>You do not have to be an owner, officer, or board member of an organization to be considered a responsible person under this penalty! You could be an employee who knew that these taxes were not being collected and didn’t do anything about it.


</p>
			<p>If you find yourself subject to the IRS Trust Fund Recovery Penalty, contact our office immediately! We may be able to reduce the penalty or eliminate it entirely.
