			<h3>Chapter 13, known as reorganization, might make the most sense for you if you have significant assets that you wish to keep.</h3>
			<hr/>
			<p>
New York law and federal law exempt certain property in bankruptcy cases, which means that a debtor gets to keep it. There are limits to the value of property protected by exemption, however. If you own a home or car that is paid off, or stock or collectibles or anything else that is worth a good amount, Chapter 7 bankruptcy (liquidation) could require that you give up these assets to pay off your debts.
</p>
			<p>
In Chapter 13, your debts will be reorganized – not liquidated. You’ll still need to pay on them – just under a new repayment plan. But under Chapter 13, you’ll get to keep assets you would have had to have sold off had you filed Chapter 7 and eliminated your debts.
</p>
			<p>
Chapter 13 can also stop the accrual of interest on any tax debt you might be carrying.
</p>
			<p>
A Chapter 13 repayment plan typically lasts three to five years. After this time, if you have held to the terms of the plan, your remaining dischargeable debt should be released.
