      <h3>A New York limited liability company (LLC) can file for Chapter 7 or Chapter 11 bankruptcy.
      </h3>
      <hr/>
      <p>
      In Chapter 7, the assets of the company are liquidated and used to pay its creditors. Any remaining debt is then eliminated, and the LLC goes out of business. In Chapter 11, the LLC stays in business, reorganizes, and makes payments to creditors over time. Chapter 7 is the most common bankruptcy filing for LLCs.
