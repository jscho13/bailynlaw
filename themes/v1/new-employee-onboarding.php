      <h3>Small businesses don’t have the budgets that larger ones do, and as such, yours may not have a dedicated human resources department.

      </h3>
      <hr/>
      <p>Many smaller firms will hand a new hire a stack of paperwork, usually including a W-4 and I-9 printed out from the Internet and an employee handbook that was created some years ago and not updated since. Although understandable – as a business owner, you have a number of pressing demands on your attention – this is not a wise way to handle onboarding, especially in New York. The State and City each have a body of highly detailed and specific employment law, and new policies are added quite often. If you skip anything, you are at risk of violating the law.


      </p>
      <p>When you put us in charge of your onboarding, we create a checklist that ensures each new employee completes all of the forms required by law. We design customized documents for our employer clients including employee handbooks, payroll/direct deposit forms, safety manuals, technology policies and procedures, and more. We update these documents as needed for our clients.


      </p><p>Call us today if your business requires assistance designing an onboarding process.
