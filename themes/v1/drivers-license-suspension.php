			<h3>Not being able to drive would be nothing short of a nightmare for most Americans.

</h3>
			<hr/>
			<p>Many New Yorkers do not know that if they fail to pay their New York State taxes, their New York State driver’s license could be suspended. This can happen when a taxpayer has a balance of $10,000 or more. The New York State Tax Department typically sends a notice to the taxpayer giving him or her 60 days to resolve the debt; if the taxpayer does not respond, the Tax Department then notifies the New York State Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV), and the DMV sends a notice notifying the taxpayer that his/her license will be suspended in 15 days if the debt is not resolved.



</p>
			<p>If you address your debt, chances are your license won’t be suspended. But many people don’t know what to do to address the debt. Some choose one option when another one is better in their specific circumstances. Some taxpayers ignore the notices entirely, and not only do their driver’s licenses get suspended, but they find themselves in much deeper trouble as the State begins collection action. Seeking the advice of a competent tax attorney is the best way to go when you are faced with an outstanding New York State tax bill.
