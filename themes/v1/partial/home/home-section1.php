      <h2>&quot;I built Bailyn Law from the ground up to solve problems and resolve disputes for  entrepreneurs.&quot;</h2>
      <p>We strategically and intelligently draft and
      negotiate business contracts, resolve business disputes and manage
      business debts. We use whatever strategies are most effective at the
      time from friendly negotiation to more neutral mediation/arbitration
      to full-scale scorched-earth litigation. </p>

      <h3>Business Contracts And Transactions</h3>

      <p>A contract is not supposed to be a garbage can full of meaningless
      boilerplate. A contract is supposed to be a detailed list of the most
      important objectives both sides wish to achieve worded in a way that
      anticipates likely problems and plans in advance how to resolve those
      problems so that the relationship stays good for the long-term. If you
      approach contracts with this understanding, you will have a relatively
      short document that resolves most problems without the need for
      outside intervention. It's a living document. Making a good contract
      doesn't take more time or effort than making a lazy one, it just takes
      a better attitude and more experience, both of which you'll get here.</p>

      <h3>Commercial Litigation - Protecting And Defending Entrepreneurs</h3>

      <p>Too many people have the understanding that when it comes to enriching themselves, the ends justify
      the means. Whatever is valuable and accessible, they'll try to take for themselves by any means possible.
      Refusing to pay for products or services they purchased, starting a competing company using stolen resources, 
      selling trade secrets to competitors, attempting to whitewash their dishonest acts via deceptive papers filed in
      court, it's a distinction barely worth making because it's all the same antisocial attitude of absolute entitlement.</p>

      <p>The good news is that determined entrepreneurs can win full repayment with legal fees and punitive damages. Some entrepreneurs will fight to the bitter end to make a point, driving the bad actor deep into bankruptcy and making them pay more than they stole. Other entrepreneurs simply want their money or property back.</p> 

      <p bold>Bottom line: not every entrepreneur is willing to accept the destruction of their company and they don't have to. If you're one of those people who believes in keeping what is yours and you're willing to defend your rights, we'll help to make your efforts productive and successful.</p>

      <h3>Business Debt Relief - For Entrepreneurs Who Learn The Hard Way</h3>

      <p>Good faith entrepreneurs come to us because they have learned the hard way how to make their
      ideas successful. The cost of learning was high and now there are
      piles of debt that need to be dealt with. Debt is like a cancer in that it
      quickly gets worse and worse until you get the necessary treatment, at
      which point it can oftentimes be controlled or eliminated.</p>

      <p>We have a lot of experience helping business owners get a fresh start, from
      bankruptcy and complex out of court debt restructurings to simple negotiations for
      more time or less money, to complete company shutdowns and layoffs.</p>
