      <p>
      The real estate attorneys at Bailyn Law are familiar with zoning and all other regulations associated with manufacturing and industrial spaces in New York City.





      </p>
      <p>There are three different levels of manufacturing districts in New York City: M1, M2, and M3, with M3 districts designated for the heaviest types of industrial use. The city has detailed rules and regulations, known as performance standards, regarding what activities may take place within each type of district. Performance standards cover things like noise, odor, smoke and vibration.





      </p><p>In addition to zoning, our attorneys will guide you through all aspects of the lease or purchasing contract, ensuring that the terms are the most favorable as can be for you and that all safety measures are taken into consideration.
