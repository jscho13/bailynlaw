      <h3>An audit by the IRS sounds very stressful. And it can be.

      </h3>
      <hr/>
      <p>An audit doesn’t always mean that there’s a problem with your individual or business tax return, but responding to a notice regarding an IRS audit appropriately is critical and crucial.

      </p>
      <p>IRS audits are conducted either by mail or in person. Either way, they’re very document-intensive and can take up a lot of your time and energy. Some people find the audit process invasive, and many become frustrated with the process.


      </p>
      <p>Legal representation by the experienced tax attorneys at Bailyn Law is a very good idea if you’re being audited by the IRS. For one thing, we’re familiar with the audit process – we know what to say to the auditors, what documents must be provided in a given situation (the fact that an IRS auditor asks you for a certain document does NOT mean that it is required!), and how to respond to the audit findings.
