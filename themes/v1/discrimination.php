      <h3>Discrimination is prohibited in any workplace under federal, New York State and New York City law.
      </h3>
      <hr/>
      <p>Everyone knows the term, but people who are starting a business for the first time (and for that matter some long-time small business owners) are probably not familiar with exactly what the laws entail.

      </p>
      <p>Discrimination refers to unfair treatment based on the protected categories of gender, race, national origin, religion, age, sexual orientation, disability and pregnancy. We design and conduct comprehensive trainings on discrimination that include examples based on each of these categories. A good annual training on the body of law surrounding discrimination can save your business much legal liability.

      </p>
      <p>Call us so that we can design a discrimination training tailored to the needs of your company.
