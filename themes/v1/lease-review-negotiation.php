			<h3>You may never have thought of using a lawyer to negotiate a lease, believing that the process was straightforward enough for you to handle on your own.

</h3>
			<hr/>
			<p>Think again. A lease is a contract, and a contract is a legal document. It’s important when signing any legal document to ensure that the terms are the most favorable that they can be for you.


</p>
			<p>Whether you are the landlord or the tenant, having a Bailyn Law attorney on your side will give you leverage as you negotiate your real estate lease. We review the document clause by clause, line by line, flagging anything that we feel might potentially harm you in some way. We are experienced in negotiating personal guarantees, good guy clauses, tenant improvement dollars, repair obligations and more.


</p>
<p>Call us today for a consultation if you’re preparing to negotiate a lease.
