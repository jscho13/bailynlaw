      <h3>Many great businesses go through hard times. A good company can find itself in a debt situation that has become unmanageable due to any number of factors.
      </h3>
      <hr/>
      <p>
      Itâ€™s uncomfortable and disconcerting to receive angry calls from lenders, suppliers, contractors and other creditors at the very time your business needs support the most.

      </p>
      <p>
      In a case such as the above, a restructuring of your debt could be the answer to your problems. Debt restructuring, which often takes the form of a Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding, is a procedure whereby a business owner and his/her attorney work together with creditors to come up with an arrangement in which the business pays its debts over a period of time (usually three to five years). This takes the pressure off of the business and turns an unmanageable situation into a manageable one.
