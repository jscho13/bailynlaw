			<h3>Our attorneys are experienced in commercial leasing on both the landlord and the tenant side.

</h3>
			<hr/>
			<p>
For landlords, we draft retail and office space leases that protect you and at the same time are advantageous to a good tenant, increasing the likelihood that the tenant will remain in your location long-term. If your business is preparing to sign a lease for a new location, we will review it line by line, section by section, clause by clause, explaining the terms to you in detail and advising you of any areas of concern.
 </p>
			<p>If you are involved in a dispute regarding a commercial lease, we will ably represent you. We are expert litigation attorneys.

</p><p>Solid, enduring relationships between commercial landlords and tenants are an essential ingredient in a healthy business climate. At Bailyn Law, we take the responsibility for advising the parties personally and seriously â€“ after all, we are a business, too.


</p><p>Call us today to schedule a consultation with a knowledgeable legal professional in the field of commercial leasing and real estate.
