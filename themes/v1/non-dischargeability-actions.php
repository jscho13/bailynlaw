      <h3>There are certain debts which are always non-dischargeable in a bankruptcy proceeding: alimony/child support, student loans, and government fines among them.
      </h3>
      <hr/>
      <p>
      Although not common, there are some cases in which a creditor will file a suit known as an adversary proceeding, alleging that certain other debts are non-dischargeable because they were caused by the debtor’s fraud, dishonesty, embezzlement, larceny, or willful and malicious conduct.

      </p>
      <p>
      Chances are that the creditor who files such a proceeding against you is somebody who has a personal beef with you. That’s when this often happens…
