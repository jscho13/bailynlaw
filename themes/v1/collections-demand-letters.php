			<h3>One of the most stressful aspects of being in business for yourself in New York is attempting to collect on delinquent monies owed.


</h3>
			<hr/>
			<p>
You may not have realized until recently how many overdue balances appear in your books. You probably don’t know the first thing about how to go about collecting the funds, or maybe you have reached out and even received promises to pay - but still nothing! You’re a very busy person and don’t have the time to go chasing people. And this is starting to affect your bottom line… 
</p>
			<p>The experienced attorneys at Bailyn Law can help you collect on your unpaid commercial debts. In many, many cases this will not involve filing suit. The first step in collecting is usually a demand letter. A properly written demand letter can be very effective in getting you paid. There is certain information that should be included in a proper demand letter, and the time frame in which letters are sent is important as well, because there are different statutes of limitations on various types of debt in New York. We are familiar with all matters involving debt and collections in New York, and will ensure that this gets done right. Call us for a consultation.
