      <h3>Sometimes itâ€™s necessary to have employees sign a non-compete agreement in order to protect the interests of your business.

      </h3>
      <hr/>
      <p>
      Unfortunately, a good number of employees who sign such agreements do not read or understand what they are signing, or even worse, disregard the agreement despite signing it. If you get wind of a former employee doing work for a competitor, or sharing trade secrets, in violation of the non-compete agreement he or she signed, you have legal recourse.





      </p>
      <p>Our attorney will typically send a letter to the former employee and/or the new employer first, before bringing the matter to court. If this is not successful, we will generally then proceed to file a lawsuit on your behalf. We will vigorously represent your interests in court, with the goal being a favorable outcome for our client. Call us for a consultation if you need to enforce a non-compete.
