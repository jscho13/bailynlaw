      <h3>Sadly, the cost of healthcare is debilitating to a huge number of Americans.

      <p>
      You can make it through a serious illness, only to be faced with a mountain of bills from hospitals, doctors, labs and other services. Your quality of life, which is only just starting to improve in your recovery, becomes diminished as you receive nasty collection calls day after day, demanding payments you have no hope of ever affording. This scenario happens even to people who have the “best” health insurance coverage out there.
      </p>
      <p>
      Without health, you have nothing. Your health is the most important thing there is. Filing for bankruptcy to deal with unmanageable medical debt is extremely common these days, and it’s absolutely nothing to be ashamed of. You did the right thing for you and your family by taking care of your health. The fact that you can’t handle the exorbitant charges associated with treatments today is not your fault, and it isn’t something you should have to spend your days worrying about.
