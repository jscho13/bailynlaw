						<div class="categoryList"><ul><li><div class="categoryListItems"><a href="<?php echo SITE_URL; ?>/tax-law-nyc-nys-irs/irs-individual-and-business-tax-audits/"><strong>Individual and Business Tax Audits</strong><p>An IRS audit can be very document-intensive and difficult to navigate.  As the consequences of delinquency can be severe, the experience is also extremely stressful for the taxpayer.  Let us advocate for you.</p></a></div></li><li><div class="categoryListItems"><a href="<?php echo SITE_URL; ?>/tax-law-nyc-nys-irs/penalty-abatement-requests/"><strong>Penalty Abatement Requests</strong><p>In certain cases, you may dispute penalties imposed by the IRS.  The grounds for a penalty abatement are highly specific, however.  We can help you determine whether you might qualify for this type of relief.</p></a></div></li><li><div class="categoryListItems"><a href="<?php echo SITE_URL; ?>/tax-law-nyc-nys-irs/assistance-for-non-filers/"><strong>Assistance for Non-Filers</strong><p>If you fail to file a tax return for a given year, the IRS may generate one for you, eliminating the opportunity for you to claim deductions and credits and resulting in a higher tax liability.  The IRS may then start collection action, which could result in a wage garnishment, freeze on your bank account, or lien on your property.  If you are delinquent in filing, please contact us.  We can assist you in becoming current.</p></a></div></li><li><div class="categoryListItems"><a href="<?php echo SITE_URL; ?>/tax-law-nyc-nys-irs/federal-tax-liens/"><strong>Federal Tax Liens</strong><p>The IRS can file a lien for unpaid taxes on your property, including real estate, financial assets, and your business’ accounts receivable.  Federal tax liens are public and remain on your credit report for seven years.  Contact us if you are facing a tax lien so that it can be resolved and its impact on you and/or your business reduced.</p></a></div></li><li><div class="categoryListItems"><a href="<?php echo SITE_URL; ?>/tax-law-nyc-nys-irs/levies-and-wage-garnishments/"><strong>Levies and Wage Garnishments</strong><p>In order to satisfy a tax debt, the IRS can issue levies on your property.  This can result in frozen bank accounts, garnishment of wages, and/or seizure of your real estate and/or vehicle(s).  IRS levies can severely impact a taxpayer’s life.  If you owe back taxes, contact us immediately to avoid levies or to address levies that currently exist.</p></a></div></li><li><div class="categoryListItems"><a href="<?php echo SITE_URL; ?>/tax-law-nyc-nys-irs/collection-due-process-hearings/"><strong>Collection Due Process Hearings</strong><p>If you receive a collection notice from the IRS, such as a Notice of Federal Tax Lien Filing or a Final Notice of Intent to Levy, contact our office.  We can determine whether you are eligible to file a request for a Collection Due Process (CDP) Hearing, which can allow you time to voluntarily resolve your liability.</p></a></div></li><li><div class="categoryListItems"><a href="<?php echo SITE_URL; ?>/tax-law-nyc-nys-irs/installment-agreements/"><strong>Installment Agreements</strong><p>Installment Agreements and Partial Pay Installment Agreements permit a taxpayer to pay an outstanding IRS tax liability over time.  Each of these payment plans requires an application process, which we are able to assist with.  Contact us to discuss your specific situation.</p></a></div></li><li><div class="categoryListItems"><a href="<?php echo SITE_URL; ?>/tax-law-nyc-nys-irs/irs-offers-in-compromise/"><strong>Offers in Compromise</strong><p>An IRS offer in compromise can be made in certain circumstances, but a thorough review of your finances – including existing assets as well as anticipated future income – will likely be conducted by before the IRS accepts such an offer.  If you are interested in an offer of compromise, we can review your finances and determine whether such an offer would be feasible in your case.</p></a></div></li><li><div class="categoryListItems"><a href="<?php echo SITE_URL; ?>/tax-law-nyc-nys-irs/trust-fund-recovery-penalties/"><strong>Trust Fund Recovery Penalties</strong><p>An IRS Trust Fund Recovery Penalty holds an officer, board member, employee, shareholder or other individual personally responsible for a business’ failure to remit payroll withholding taxes.  If you have been or may be assessed this penalty, please contact us – we may be able to help.</p></a></div></li><li><div class="categoryListItems"><a href="<?php echo SITE_URL; ?>/tax-law-nyc-nys-irs/innocent-spouse-relief-claims/"><strong>Innocent Spouse Relief Claims</strong><p>If a married couple files joint federal tax returns, each spouse is personally liable for all taxes, interest and penalties.  Innocent Spouse Relief can relieve one spouse from some or all of this liability if certain qualifications are met.  If you feel this may apply to you, please reach out to us.</p></a></div></li></ul></div>
