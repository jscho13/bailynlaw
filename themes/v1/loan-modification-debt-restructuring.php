      Here at Bailyn Law, we assist clients in obtaining loan modifications so that further collection activity, foreclosure, and bankruptcy can be avoided. In loan modification, the terms of a loan are changed so that it becomes manageable and affordable. In this way, you will be able to become current, resume making payments, and move on with your life free of the stress that this obligation has been causing you or your business.

      </p>

      Other forms of debt can be restructured as well without it being necessary to file for bankruptcy. Please call us for a consultation relating to your specific situation.
