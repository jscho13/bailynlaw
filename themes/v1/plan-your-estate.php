 …or an equivalent level of pain and destruction of family relationships. Frequently so much is wasted on taxes, medical expenses, creditors of your beneficiaries and poor management decisions that nothing good or bad is accomplished other than wasting everyone’s time and all your money.

It’s sickening to see a person go though a lifetime of self-deprivation for the benefit of their family, only for the money to be distributed to their heirs’ creditors after their death, with nothing going to the people the money was for. The success of your estate planning is a function of the care and strategy with which your estate is planned. Most lawyers don’t even understand the basics of estate planning, and asset preservation and protection. Possibly not even Medicaid planning. At our firm, we practice is many areas including real estate, bankruptcy, collections/creditors’ rights, estate planning and probate law. Nothing is 100%, but we can certainly get you a lot closer to your goal than other law firms.
