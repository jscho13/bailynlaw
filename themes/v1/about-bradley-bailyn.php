<h3 class="text-center"><strong>Is Your Attorney Afraid Of Success?</strong></h3>
<p>
In the title I asked if your attorney is afraid of success. It's funny
but it's certainly not a joke. There is a strong, unspoken rule that
everything should be compromised, settled and made to disappear. When
you live by that rule, never taking a meaningful stand for any reason,
everybody likes you - your colleagues, adversaries and often your own
clients.</p>

<p>But professional excellence is not about being good enough.
It requires a certain comfort level with people resenting you
because they feel you got more than you deserved. You got what they
deserved. There are times when everybody wins and I always shoot for
that outcome. But realistically, people often hire lawyers when there
is a zero-sum game. Somebody needs to win and somebody needs to lose.</p>

<p>I consider myself an activist for property owners and developers,
trade contractors, design and construction professionals,
logistics/transport companies and entrepreneurs in general.  I believe
that I protect people who create real value for society from people
who seek to waste, misuse or embezzle resources that rightfully belong
elsewhere. There is a clear right and a clear wrong and not every
matter can or should be settled every time.</p>

<p>On a personal level, clients hire me because I'm an independent,
take-charge person who does not shirk from responsibility. I have been
in charge of overseeing other law firms, am often the only person
trusted with intimate knowledge of my clients' business arrangements
and personal assets  for the benefit of their children if something were
to happen to them, and I have a massive list of industry contacts to
use for my clients' benefit.</p>
