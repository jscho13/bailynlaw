      <h3>Healthcare is a special sector because its business is to serve. Oftentimes this service is provided on a charitable basis, free or at reduced rates.


      </h3>
      <hr/>
      <p>Health insurance companies deny claims every day. Hospitals, medical offices, and other healthcare offices often seek bankruptcy protection because they simply do not have enough cash coming in to cover the costs to maintain their facilities. Even organizations that receive public funds are having a hard time, as that funding has lessened over the years.


      </p>
      <p>We can help you through the financial muck and mire so that you can stay focused on what you and your facility do best â€“ taking care of people. Talk to us about Chapter 11 restructuring and other ways to ease financial pain.
