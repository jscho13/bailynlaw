      <h3>An individual or business in New York owes you money and has filed for bankruptcy.


      </h3>
      <hr/>
      <p>
      This is stressful enough – you are wondering whether you have a chance of being paid, and if so, how much of the debt will be satisfied. Now you find that the debtor has paid another creditor ahead of you. Could this mean that now you’ll get nothing back at all? Is there anything that you can do in this situation?


      </p>
      <p>
      Bailyn Law’s attorneys are bankruptcy experts, and can guide you in filing a preferential transfer lawsuit in which we’ll fight to have the money taken back from the preferred creditor and put back into the debtor’s pool of assets so that it can be divided up equitably amongst the creditors and you can receive your fair share.
