      <h3>As a healthcare professional, you probably took a course on HIPAA (the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996) as part of your formal or continuing education.
      </h3>
      <hr/>
      <p>But as a practice owner, can you be sure you’re fully in compliance? The law is highly detailed, and every member of a healthcare facility’s staff is responsible for making sure it is followed.

      </p>
      <p>The core of HIPAA involves safeguarding the Protected Health Information (PHI) of patients. Information is considered PHI if it consists of “individually identifiable health information” plus “information that can be used to identify a patient”.

      </p>
      <p>Our attorneys possess expert knowledge of the rules governing who is required to comply with HIPAA, what information is considered PHI and must be protected, to whom HIPAA may be disclosed, and what forms, if any, are required to be completed by patients. We train your office staff and create compliance manuals for practices of all kinds and sizes.
