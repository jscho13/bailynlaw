      <h3>The most common types of secured debt are mortgages and automobile loans.

      </h3>
      <hr/>
      <p>
      When filing for bankruptcy in New York State, you have different options for dealing with these debts depending on what you want to do with the property.



      </p>
      <p>
      If you want to stay in your home, filing Chapter 13 bankruptcy is often the best option. In a Chapter 13 proceeding, past due mortgage payments along with other debts are placed into a repayment plan.



      </p>
      <p>
      If the house or car has become completely unaffordable, you can file Chapter 7 bankruptcy, in which you give the property up, the associated debts are eliminated, and you can start fresh.
