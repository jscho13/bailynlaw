      <h3>Are you in significant debt and receiving disability benefits?

      </h3>
      <hr/>
      <p>
      Are you forgoing the essentials – food, medical aids, transportation – and using your disability payments to satisfy hospital or credit card debt? Is a relative’s quality of life suffering because he or she is picking up the slack and helping you out financially?


      </p>
      <p>
      In New York State, disability benefits are not considered assets when filing Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Filing Chapter 7 will eliminate your credit card, medical, and other consumer debts so that you can use your Social Security, Workers’ Compensation, and other money to pay for what it was intended for – your day-to-day needs. If you are on disability and need help dealing with creditors, call our experienced attorneys. You deserve your well-being back.
