      <h3>A preferential transfer action is an action taken by a bankruptcy trustee related to monies that you have paid to a creditor.
      </h3>
      <hr/>
      <p>
      If the trustee feels that you gave preferential treatment to that creditor by making the payment that you did, the trustee can sue to get the money back from the creditor and put it back into your bankruptcy estate to be divided up amongst all your creditors.

      </p>
