			<h3>A cease and desist letter is a demand to an individual, business or other entity that they stop doing something that is violating your legal rights.
</h3>
			<hr/>
			<p>In a cease and desist letter, it is stated that if the activity on the part of the addressee does not stop, further legal action will be taken. Situations in which cease and desist letters are used in New York include patent, trademark, and copyright infringement; stalking and other forms of harassment; libel and slander; and breach of contract.

</p>
			<p>It is absolutely unacceptable for you, your family, and/or your business to be violated. We can write a strongly worded cease and desist letter that in many cases will get the violator(s) to back off for good. If the activity continues, we will look at further actions to take, including taking the offender(s) to court. Please call us if you are experiencing a troubling situation like the ones described here.
