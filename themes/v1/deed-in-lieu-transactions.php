      <h3>When you are behind on your mortgage in New York, it is possible that your lender may agree to a deed in lieu of foreclosure.
      </h3>
      <hr/>
      <p>
      What this means is that instead of foreclosing on the home, the lender accepts the deed to the property as full satisfaction of the mortgage debt.

      </p>
      <p>
      The advantages to a deed in lieu of foreclosure are 1) that the mortgage debt is wiped out in full; and 2) that your credit is not affected in the way it would be had foreclosure or bankruptcy taken place.
