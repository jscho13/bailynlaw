      <h3>Your New York business has a stellar reputation and generates tons of revenue.
      </h3>
      <hr/>
      <p>
      Now it’s time to renew your lease, and to your dismay the landlord has raised your rent exponentially. Just like that, a business that has never seen trouble is now staring it right in the face.

      </p>
      <p>
      You try to carry on, thinking you’ll be able to handle this somehow. Now six months have gone by and you’re saddled with debt. Creditors with whom you’ve always been on good terms are calling you and angrily demanding payment. There’s significant time left on the lease. You can’t believe this is happening to the business you worked so hard to build and make great.

      </p>
      <p>
      Filing Chapter 11 bankruptcy can enable you to end this lease and to reorganize your other debts so that you can go back to doing what you do best in your business. Call us for more information.
