Loan modification is one way to avoid foreclosure and keep you and you and your family where you are.



</p>
			<p>
Loan modification is often done in tandem with a bankruptcy filing, buy not always. In loan modification, your bank reviews your financial situation as a whole and come up with payment arrangements that fit your situation. The idea is for you to get back on track with your payments under the modified terms and thereby avert foreclosure.



</p>
			<p>
Loan modifications can be difficult and overwhelming if you try to handle them without the assistance of a competent attorney. Don’t forget – you’re dealing with your mortgage lender, a creditor who wants your money and is acting in its interest first. We are very familiar with loan modifications and would be happy to discuss your situation. Call us.
