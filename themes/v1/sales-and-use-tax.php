			<h3>If your business is registered as a vendor in New York State, you are required by law to collect and remit New York State sales tax.

</h3>
			<hr/>
			<p>It is very important before beginning business to obtain a Certificate of Authority from the New York State Tax Department – and then to keep accurate records of State sales tax collected and paid.


</p>
			<p>If you are audited by the State Tax Department and the findings are that you’ve paid inadequate sales tax, you can be assessed additional taxes, as well as interest and penalties. If the State deems you to have willfully failed to maintain proper records, you may even be subject to criminal penalties.



</p>
			<p>If you have sales tax questions, please call us. If you receive notification that a sales tax audit is going to be performed, reach out to us immediately so that we can assist you through the process and make it as painless as possible.
