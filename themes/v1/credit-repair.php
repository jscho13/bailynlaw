      We specialize in assisting people who have filed for bankruptcy in repairing their credit, learning new financial habits if they need to, and even in dealing with creditors who may have not quit harassing them subsequent to filing (this does not happen in most cases – but if it does, we’re on it!).



      </p>
      <p>
      If you have not yet filed for bankruptcy and are thinking of doing so, please reach out to us to schedule a consultation. We will examine your unique situation and if bankruptcy is the best option, we will be by your side before, during and after the proceeding, expertly representing and advocating for you and answering any questions you may have.



      </p>
      <p>
      If you have already filed and would like help getting “back in the game”, also call us. We are financial attorneys and are here for you wherever you are in your journey.
