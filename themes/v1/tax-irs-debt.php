      Many people do not realize that some income tax obligations, including interest and penalties, are indeed dischargeable in bankruptcy, meaning they can be eliminated. The specifics are highly detailed, however, and virtually impossible to understand without the help of an attorney who is knowledgeable about both tax and bankruptcy laws.



      </p>
      <p>
      Call us to schedule a consultation. We will look at your situation and see if bankruptcy is a tool that can be implemented to resolve any or all of your federal and/or state tax liability. If bankruptcy is not the answer, there are other legal avenues.
