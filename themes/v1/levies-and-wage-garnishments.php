			<h3>A levy is a collection method used by the IRS in which it seizes your property in order to satisfy an outstanding tax liability.

</h3>
			<hr/>
			<p>A common form of levy is one issued by the IRS to a taxpayer’s bank – this is commonly referred to as one’s bank account being frozen. Another form of levy is wage garnishment, in which the IRS takes a portion of the taxpayer’s paycheck. Vehicles, real estate, and other non-financial assets may be taken by the IRS via levy as well.


</p>
			<p>IRS levies can cripple your life. Imagine not being able to use your bank account. Imagine that most of your pay is taken and you’re left with a bare minimum for you and your family to live on. The IRS is not subject to garnishment limitations placed on other creditors; it can take a majority of your earnings until your tax debt is paid.



</p>
			<p>If you owe back federal taxes, I cannot stress enough the importance of contacting a skilled, qualified attorney! There are ways to avoid garnishments, account freezes and other IRS levies. We can help you. Call us.
