			<h3>So you’ve received a notice from the New York State Tax Department advising you that you or your business is being audited. What now?

</h3>
			<hr/>
			<p>First of all, don’t worry. The State decides to audit tax returns for all sorts of reasons. The information that you submitted on a return might not match what the State has on file: for example, the State may have income on file for you that you neglected to include on your return because the W-2 or 1099 got lost in the mail and you simply forgot about it. In some cases, a number of returns are all audited for an identical reason, and it’s not about anything you did at all!


</p>
			<p>People get stressed about tax audits because they fear that they are “in trouble” and will have to pay more. Remember: an audit is simply an examination of your return. The finding of the audit could be that you underpaid, but the audit could also find that you overpaid and are due a refund! If the audit finds that you overpaid, you’ll get a bill. A good tax attorney will guide you through the audit process and will advise you of next steps in the event that you are assessed additional tax, interest and/or penalties.
