      <h3>A Collection Due Process (CDP) hearing may be requested by a taxpayer to protest a collection action taken by the IRS.

      </h3>
      <hr/>
      <p>In most cases, upon receipt of a Notice of Intent to Levy, you have 30 days in which to file a request for a CDP hearing. At this hearing, you may ask that your tax debt be handled in a different way â€“ through an installment agreement or Offer in Compromise, for instance.



      </p>
      <p>You should contact an attorney if you receive any sort of collection notice from the IRS. The knowledgeable professionals here at Bailyn Law will be able to explain to you what it is that you have received and what steps can be taken to address and resolve the issue.
