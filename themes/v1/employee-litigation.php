			<h3>You hope, as a New York business owner, that you are hiring quality employees who have the interests of your company at heart and will give their best efforts to contribute to your success.

</h3>
			<hr/>
			<p>
You know, however, that you will make some staffing decisions that don’t turn out as planned. In today’s world, you’re likely to encounter at least one – probably more than one – employee who puts you in a situation in which you need to reach out to an attorney.

 
</p>
			<p>A former employee may sue, alleging wrongful termination or failure to pay wages or commissions allegedly owed. A current one may file a discrimination lawsuit. You may get wind of the fact that someone who used to work for you has taken your trade secrets to another company, or violated the terms of a non-compete agreement.




</p><p>Our attorneys are experienced and adept at representing you in any of these circumstances. Our goal is to bring the matter to a swift and decisive resolution and an outcome favorable to you. Please call us to schedule a consultation.
