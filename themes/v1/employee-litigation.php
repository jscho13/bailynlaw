      You know, however, that you will make some staffing decisions that don’t turn out as planned. In today’s world, you’re likely to encounter at least one – probably more than one – employee who puts you in a situation in which you need to reach out to an attorney.


      </p>
      <p>A former employee may sue, alleging wrongful termination or failure to pay wages or commissions allegedly owed. A current one may file a discrimination lawsuit. You may get wind of the fact that someone who used to work for you has taken your trade secrets to another company, or violated the terms of a non-compete agreement.




      </p><p>Our attorneys are experienced and adept at representing you in any of these circumstances. Our goal is to bring the matter to a swift and decisive resolution and an outcome favorable to you. Please call us to schedule a consultation.
