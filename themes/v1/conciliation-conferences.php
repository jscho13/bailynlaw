      <h3>You or your business have been audited by the New York State Tax Department, and you disagree with the findings. What now?

      </h3>
      <hr/>
      <p>Within the State Tax Department is an independent bureau called the Bureau of Conciliation and Mediation Services (BCMS). The purpose of BCMS is to conduct conciliation conferences in the event a taxpayer disputes the State’s findings. A conciliation conference is often recommended as a first action to take instead of filing a petition with the Division of Tax Appeals. It’s less expensive, and it’s quicker.


      </p>
      <p>The conciliation conference consists of you, a Tax Department representative, and an impartial conferee who is there to mediate. Having an experienced, knowledgeable tax attorney with you during the conference increases the likelihood of an outcome that is more favorable to you.
