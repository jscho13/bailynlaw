Our mission is to protect, defend and advance the rights of founding shareholders, entrepreneurs, impact investors, trust beneficiaries and other real or intellectual property owners against those aggressive and dishonest people who would waste, misuse or confiscate those assets.
</p><p>
We understand that your company and/or property is your life's investment. It is your retirement plan, your children's future and the embodiment of everything you believe in wrapped up in one. In the case of a company, it maybe all of those things for the employees, as well. Many people are left physically ill by the feeling of helplessness as they watch their lives go up in smoke. In this case the situation rises to the level of a medical emergency.
</p><p>
If you're saying, "Yes, that's me!" it's because your situation is unfortunately common. But the good news is that there are lawyers out there who get the risks and the consequences and are brave enough to win.
</p>
	
<h3 class="text-blue-header">Boarding Up The Windows</h3>	
<p>
We don’t like to see our clients spend money on legal fees just to do it. The first thing that we need to do is meet and determine what is the least costly way to resolve the situation. This may seem like common sense, but a lot of companies and other assets have no independent value. A lot of times they have negative value. Literally all of the company's value is in the knowledge and relationships belonging to one person, and the company is otherwise a pile of debts and liabilities. Or a piece of real estate is so tied up with mortgages and other liens that it does not require any further protection. In cases like that we oftentimes just close the company, or file personal bankruptcy to get rid of lawsuits, debts and other the liabilities.
</p><p>
When companies or other assets do have independent value because of valuable patents, leases, equipment, brand recognition, etc. then we have to protect that value. Depending on what the threat is, we can do a lot of different things. We can sell, lease or license assets, renegotiate debts, end relationships with vendors, contractors and staff, file lawsuits with emergency restraining orders, limit the scope and duration of investigations by government agencies, etc.
</p>

<h3 class="text-blue-header">Direct Action When Your Company Or Property Are Under Attack</h3>
<p>
You maybe dealing with lawsuits, government fines and investigations, activists, abusive employees, severe breach of contract or theft of trade secrets or other property. No matter what it is, aggressors almost all do the same thing. They play “good guy” expertly. They loudly and dramatically cry out for justice while depriving their victim of justice. They frame their intimidation tactics as necessary in the face of the "true aggressor" (their victim.)
</p><p>
Settling with these people is a moving target. They pretend to be near settling but they never settle because the discussions are just pretext to distract attention from their illegal conduct. The most sickening part of the whole thing is that these people are expert manipulators and oftentimes judges, the press, customers and even the other attorney (your lawyer) buy what they’re selling, forcing the victim to be victimized repeatedly until they walk away from their assets. A key part of our job is getting your story heard.
</p><p>
At this firm, we treat scorpions like scorpions. We match their aggression with the harshest justice the law allows. We don't try to deal with them like reasonable people because they're not. We do everything within our power to put the consequences of their actions in their face. This gets our clients relief as quickly as possible.
