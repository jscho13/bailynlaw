      <h3>Airtight contracts with suppliers are important for any New York business.


      </h3>
      <hr/>
      <p>
      Too often, a companyâ€™s relationship with a vendor is fraught with ambiguity. This can cause a serious problem when an order does not arrive as expected. Without the supplies, you may not be able to conduct business and service your clients/customers.





      </p>
      <p>A good supplier contract spells out all of the terms and conditions in full detail. It indicates the specific deliverables to be provided by the supplier, the pricing schedule, and the invoicing process. It clearly states the responsibilities of both parties.
