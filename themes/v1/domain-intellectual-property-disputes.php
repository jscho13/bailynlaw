			<h3>Copyrights, trademarks, and branding – including domain names – are valuable assets to a New York business.</h3>
			<hr/>
			<p>Is another entity using assets that belong to you? Is a current or former employee making use of your intellectual property without your consent, for his or her own gain?</p>
			<p>At Bailyn Law we fight hard to protect our clients’ intangible assets. We handle cases involving cybersquatting – in which a party is hijacking a domain name so that the trademark owner is unable to acquire it without paying a hefty price. If your copyrighted designs are being used by another, we will take swift and decisive action and demand that this stop. If a former employee has brought your business’ trade secrets to your competition, we will treat this matter with the gravity it deserves. Call us to schedule a consultation today.
