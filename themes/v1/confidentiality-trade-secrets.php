      <h3>Does your business have trade secrets? Do you have policies and procedures in place to keep them protected?
      </h3>
      <hr/>
      <p>A trade secret is a piece of information, not known to others outside your business, that gives you an advantage over your competition. In order to be considered a trade secret, your business must take measures to ensure that it stays a secret. One of the best ways to do this is to have your employees, and anyone else with access to the trade secret, sign a non-disclosure agreement (NDA).

      </p>
      <p>If you find out that your trade secret has been or is being used by another entity, New York law provides for a three-year statute of limitations within which to file a misappropriation lawsuit.

      </p>
      <p>We are experienced in crafting non-disclosure agreements, can advise you on how best to protect your New York businessâ€™ trade secrets, and will represent you vigorously in the event that this confidential material is stolen from you. Call us today to schedule a consultation.
