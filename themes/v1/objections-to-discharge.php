      <h3>Discharge refers to the elimination of debts in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. In most cases, when an individual in New York files for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, the process is fairly straightforward.
      </h3>
      <hr/>
      <p>
      Although not commonplace, there are some cases in which the Chapter 7 trustee, or a creditor, can file an objection to discharge, alleging that the debtor hid or destroyed assets, falsified records, or made false statements.

      </p>
      <p>
      Our attorneys are experienced in defending clients against objections to discharge filed by creditors or trustees. We believe that the people we represent deserve a fresh financial start. The majority of consumer bankruptcy proceedings will not involve a legal action being taken by a creditor or trustee. But if this happens, we at Bailyn Law will fight for you.
