â€¦or if someone died without leaving a will and you think you might have rights, it is very important that you use an attorney who will formally protect your rights under the law. Even more seriously, fraud is very common when it comes to wills and you want to work with a law firm that knows what to look for and will bring to your attention inconsistencies and possibly make you aware of assets you would never even know existed.
