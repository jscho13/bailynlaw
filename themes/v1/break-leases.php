      <h3>So you want to break a lease in New York. It can be done! You may even be able to get your security deposit back.

      </h3>
      <hr/>
      <p>But you probably won’t be successful unless you hire a competent attorney to guide you through the process. A lease is a legal, binding contract, and although getting out is possible, it takes some work.



      </p>
      <p>There is a law in New York that requires a landlord to “assign” a lease to a new, qualified tenant should one be found. Assignment is also an involved legal process, and one you should not be attempting to handle without legal assistance.


      </p><p>If you’re looking to end a lease early, please give us a call. There are various options available, and our attorneys will review your particular circumstances and advise as to what option makes the most sense for you.
