      <h3>New York State has various means by which it collects on unpaid taxes.

      </h3>
      <hr/>
      <p>Collection activity begins when the State Department of Taxation and Finance files a tax warrant – a public document on file with the Secretary of State and County Clerk’s Office. Once the tax warrant is filed, the State can attempt to collect the outstanding balance.


      </p>
      <p>A levy is a legal order that requires a third party, usually your bank, to turn your funds over to the State to satisfy your tax debt. This is also known as a freeze on your bank account. The State does not provide notice that a levy will be issued; it is typically discovered when a taxpayer attempts to use the funds. Suddenly finding yourself unable to use the money in your bank account can be a very, very scary occurrence!


      </p>
      <p>The State also collects via income execution (wage garnishments) and seizure of a taxpayer’s personal property.
      </p>
      <p>If you have an outstanding tax bill and need help bringing it to resolution, please call us. We would like to get this matter resolved for you before collection action has the chance to begin.
