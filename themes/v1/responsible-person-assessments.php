      <h3>If a business has unpaid State sales or payroll withholding tax, the State Tax Department may go after the personal assets of individuals they deem “responsible persons”.


      </h3>
      <hr/>
      <p>The word “responsible” in this context is synonymous with “liable”.



      </p>
      <p>The State holds a responsible person personally liable for 100 percent of a business’ unpaid withholding or sales tax, regardless of this individual’s stake in ownership of the business. Sales tax never belongs to the business – rather, the business collects it, holds it in trust for New York State, and is expected to remit it promptly. Failure to remit sales tax collected is a CRIME.


      </p>
      <p>Contact us immediately if you receive word from the New York State Tax Department that you are being pursued as a responsible person! This is very serious and impacts not only your business but yourself and your family.
